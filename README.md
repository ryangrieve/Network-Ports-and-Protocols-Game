# Network-Ports-and-Protocols-Game
This project is a simple game designed to test a player's knowledge of network ports and protocols. The game has a dictionary that maps the names of various network protocols to their respective port numbers. At the start of the game, the player is prompted to choose the length of the quiz, after which the game generates a series of questions, each asking for the port number associated with a randomly chosen protocol. The player's score is calculated based on the number of correct answers, and the result is displayed as a percentage. The player can choose to play again after the first round or close the game.
